## Contribution

We welcome contributions from the community! Here are some ways you can contribute:

- **Bug fixes:** If you find a bug, please report it by opening an issue on GitHub. If you're able to fix the bug yourself, please submit a pull request with your changes.
- **New features:** If you have an idea for a new feature, please open an issue to discuss it with the maintainers before starting work on it.
- **Documentation improvements:** If you see any areas where the documentation could be improved, please submit a pull request with your changes.

### Tests & validation

Before submitting a pull request, please ensure that all tests and validation tasks pass. Here's how to run them:

1. Install the project dependencies: `npm install`
2. Run the tests: `npm run test`
3. Run the linter: `npm run lint`

### Readme

The Readme file is automatically generated from the Markdown files located in the `docs/` directory. This ensures that the Readme is always up-to-date with the latest information about the project.

To update the Readme, please make changes to the relevant Markdown files in the `docs/` directory and then run the following command:

```bash
npm run docs
```

This will concatenate the Markdown files, validate them, and update the `README.md` file.

**Note:** Do not edit the `README.md` directly, as it will be overwritten!
